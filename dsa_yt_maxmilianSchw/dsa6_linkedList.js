Custom Data Structures:

1. Linked List:

Definition:

A List data structure in which all the elements are linked to each other. Each element in a linked list not only has value, but a pointer to the next element too. so every element knows about its next element. 

-> very effective when it comes to resizing the list for memory management.

-> insertion at start and end is very easy as compared to Array.

-> the basic idea of a linked list is that, every node(element) in a list only knows about the next node, it doesn't need to know about the list it is part of. similarly the list doesn't need to know about all the nodes inside it, it just need to know about the first(head) and the last(tail) node. do we need not to store the entire list.
